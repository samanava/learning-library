# Install VNC Server - LiveLabs

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to install a VNC Server, for graphical applications, on a Compute Instance.

# Prerequisites
This lab assumes that you have created a Compute Instance using an image that does not contain a VNC server or an application development environment.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace offers a <a href="https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/adf.task-flow?adf.tfId=adhtf&adf.tfDoc=/WEB-INF/taskflow/adhtf.xml&application_id=54030984" "target=\_blank">Developer Image /a> that you can use to create an Oracle Cloud Compute instance to serve as your application development system. This image is preconfigured to contain many development tools and utilities.

## Task 1: Install VNC Server and GNOME Desktop

1. Open an SSH or Putty connection to your Compute Instance and log in as *opc*
![./images/putty_connect.png]()

2. Install the GNOME desktop
````
<copy>
sudo yum -y groups install "Server with GUI"
</copy>
````
You will see output similar to:
````
Loaded plugins: langpacks, ulninfo
Repository ol7_latest is listed more than once in the configuration

3. Install a VNC Server. We use TigerVNC in this example

````
<copy>
sudo yum -y install tigervnc-server
</copy>
````
You will see output similar to:
````
Loaded plugins: langpacks, ulninfo

3. Configure your VNC server

````
vncserver
````
You will be required to provide a *password* that you will need to remember to be able to access this server via VNC. There is no need to enter a *view-only password*.

You will see output similar to:
````
You will require a password to access your desktops.
Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
A view-only password is not used
xauth:  file /home/opc/.Xauthority does not exist

New 'instance-2019xxx-15xx:1 (opc)' desktop is instance-2019xxx-15xx:1

Creating default startup script /home/opc/.vnc/xstartup
Creating default config /home/opc/.vnc/config
Starting applications specified in /home/opc/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /home/opc/.vnc/instance-20191113-1544:1.log

# Step 2 VNC Viewer On your laptop
If you are using an Apple Mac, you can use the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-the-screen-of-another-mac-mh14066/mac" "target=\_blank"> Screen Sharing application </a>. On other operating systems you will need a suitable VNC viewer.

1. Install a VNC viewer for Windows
<a href="https://tigervnc.org/TigerVNC" "target=\_blank"> TigerVNC</a> is available from *My Desktop* for Oracle employees

2. Configure an SSH Tunnel
You will need the full path to the SSH private-key generated earlier and the IP address of your Compute Instance

Open a Terminal Window on Apple Mac or Powershell on Windows (Press the Windows key and search for Powershell)
![./images/powershell.png]()

````
ssh -N -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -i 'C:\My_SSH_Key\My_compute_instance_private_key_openSSH.ppk' opc@120.130.140.10
````
*Note* You will need the path to your private key and the IP address of your Compute Instance
*Note* You must either be outside the Oracle Firewall (VPN NOT running) or have a proxy defined
Do Not close the Powershell Window or Mac terminal window - this will close the tunnel

This will create a tunnel for VNC through SHH.

3. Open a VNC Viewer using *localhost:1* as the address of the VNC Server
![./images/tigervnc-viewer.png]()

# Step 3 Connect to the VNC Server on your Compute Instance
1. Provide the password you set for the VNC Server
![./images/tigervnc_autheticate.png]()

#Step 4 Configure GNOME desktop - on first login

1. The first time you login to the VNC viewer you will be asked a series of questions to configure the GNOME desktop:
![./images/Gnome_setup_1.png]()

Choose your language of choice, keyboard layout, privacy setting for Location Services, and *Skip* conecting your online accounts.

# Step 5 - Logged in

1. You should now be logged in to your Compute Instance
